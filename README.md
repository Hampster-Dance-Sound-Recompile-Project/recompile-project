# Hampster Dance Sound Recompile Project

A project to recompile the hampster dance sound from the source - legally. 
You bring FFMPEG, Make, and an MP3 of [the 1973 Robin Hood intro from Disney,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKYEKhxWy6o)
the Makefile takes care of the rest.

## How do I use this?

* Obtain ffmpeg and make
* Git clone this repo
* "Legally" obtain a copy of an mp3 of the 1973 Robin Hood intro - copy it to the cloned project folder as "robinhood_intro.mp3"
* Run:
```make```

The makefile will do the magic of recreating the hampster dance. Happy hampster dancin!
